## Support & Troubleshooting

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify customer types
PGPASSWORD=<REDACTED_DB_PASSWORD> psql -h /var/run/postgresql -U hamees_user -d tailor_inventory -c \
  "SELECT customerType, COUNT(*) FROM \"Customer\" GROUP BY customerType;"

# Verify tailor assignments
PGPASSWORD=<REDACTED_DB_PASSWORD> psql -h /var/run/postgresql -U hamees_user -d tailor_inventory -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assignedTailorId IS NOT NULL) as assigned,
   COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assignedTailorId IS NULL) as unassigned
   FROM \"OrderItem\";"

# Verify GST on purchase orders
PGPASSWORD=<REDACTED_DB_PASSWORD> psql -h /var/run/postgresql -U hamees_user -d tailor_inventory -c \
  "SELECT poNumber, subTotal, gstAmount, totalAmount,
   ROUND((gstAmount / subTotal * 100)::numeric, 2) as calculated_rate
   FROM \"PurchaseOrder\" LIMIT 5;"

# Verify ITC tracking
PGPASSWORD=<REDACTED_DB_PASSWORD> psql -h /var/run/postgresql -U hamees_user -d tailor_inventory -c \

## Appendix: SQL Verification Queries

### Complete Verification Query
```sql
-- Comprehensive data verification
SELECT
  'Customers' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN customerType = 'B2B' THEN 1 END) as metric_1,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN customerType = 'B2C' THEN 1 END) as metric_2,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN gstin IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as metric_3
FROM "Customer"
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'OrderItems',
  COUNT(*),
  COUNT(CASE WHEN assignedTailorId IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END),
  COUNT(CASE WHEN assignedTailorId IS NULL THEN 1 END),
  0
FROM "OrderItem"
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'PurchaseOrders',
  COUNT(*),
  COUNT(CASE WHEN gstAmount > 0 THEN 1 END),
  COUNT(CASE WHEN itcClaimed = true THEN 1 END),
  COUNT(CASE WHEN supplierInvoiceNumber IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END)
FROM "PurchaseOrder";
```

**Expected Output:**
```
table_name      | total | metric_1 | metric_2 | metric_3
----------------+-------+----------+----------+----------
