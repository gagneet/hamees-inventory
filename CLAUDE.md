- No changes required (uses existing `paidAmount`, `balanceAmount`, `status` fields)

**Permissions:**
- Requires `manage_inventory` permission (Owner, Admin, Inventory Manager)

**Testing:**
```bash
# Login as Inventory Manager
Email: inventory@hameesattire.com
Password: admin123

# Test Workflow:
1. Open any PO with items received but balance > 0
2. Notice status is "PARTIAL" (not "RECEIVED")
3. Click "Make Payment" button
4. Verify balance is pre-filled
5. Select payment mode (e.g., "Bank Transfer")
6. Enter transaction reference (e.g., "TXN123456")
7. Click "Record Payment"
→ Status changes to "RECEIVED", balance = ₹0
```

**Breaking Changes:**
- None (backward compatible - existing POs automatically use new status logic)

**Documentation:**
- See `docs/PURCHASE_ORDER_PAYMENT_SYSTEM.md` for complete API reference, workflows, and testing scenarios

### ✅ Dashboard Interactivity Fixes (v0.13.2)

**What's New:**
- **Real Data Verification** - Confirmed all Business Metrics use live database data
- **Fabric Chart Navigation** - Clicking fabric slices now filters orders by that specific fabric
- **Customer Retention Clickable** - Pie chart now interactive with detailed customer information
- **Fixed Status Filter** - Orders page properly responds to status filter navigation from dashboard

**Issues Fixed:**

1. **Business Metrics Validation**
   - **Inventory Value**: Real-time calculation from `currentStock × price` for all items
   - **Stock Turnover**: Calculated from actual stock movements in last 30 days
   - **Total Orders**: Direct count from database
   - **Fulfillment Rate**: Dynamic calculation `(delivered / total) × 100`

2. **Revenue by Fabric Type Navigation** (`components/dashboard/owner-dashboard.tsx`, `app/api/dashboard/enhanced-stats/route.ts`)
   - **Before**: Clicking any fabric navigated to `/inventory` (generic inventory page)
   - **After**: Clicking individual slices navigates to `/orders?fabricId={id}` (filtered orders for that fabric)
   - Added fabric `id` to API response
   - Added onClick handler to pie chart slices
   - Shows only orders using the selected fabric

3. **Customer Retention Chart Interactivity** (`components/dashboard/customer-retention-chart.tsx`)
   - **Before**: Only button below chart was clickable
   - **After**: Pie chart itself is now clickable
   - Clicking "Returning Customers" slice opens dialog
   - Shows customers with 3+ orders, months active, order history
   - Added visual indicator: "Click on 'Returning Customers' to view details"

4. **Orders by Status Filter** (`app/(dashboard)/orders/page.tsx`)
   - **Root Cause**: useEffect watched entire `searchParams` object instead of individual parameters
   - **Fix**: Updated dependency array to watch individual URL parameters
   - **Result**: Clicking "Delivered" on dashboard now properly shows only delivered orders
   - Works for all navigation: status charts, fabric filters, arrears buttons

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/dashboard/enhanced-stats/route.ts` - Added fabric ID to revenue data (line 610)
- `components/dashboard/owner-dashboard.tsx` - Made fabric slices clickable (lines 307-369)
- `components/dashboard/customer-retention-chart.tsx` - Made chart interactive (lines 64-107)
- `app/(dashboard)/orders/page.tsx` - Fixed URL parameter reactivity (lines 70-103)

**Files Added:**
- `docs/DASHBOARD_INTERACTIVITY_FIXES.md` - Complete technical documentation with testing checklist

**User Impact:**
- Dashboard now fully interactive with accurate data-driven navigation
- All charts clickable with proper filtering
- Clear visual indicators for interactive elements
- Improved user experience with instant feedback

### ✅ Order Management Enhancements & UI Fixes (v0.12.0)

**What's New:**
- **Order Splitting** - Split multi-item orders into separate orders for independent management
- **Enhanced Customer Cards** - Detailed order metrics with clickable dialogs showing order lists
- **Dialog Visibility Fixes** - Fixed text visibility issues across all popup/modal components
- **Accurate Order Counts** - Fixed customer order count display to show actual totals

**New Features:**

1. **Order Splitting System** (`app/api/orders/[id]/split/route.ts`, `components/orders/split-order-dialog.tsx`)
   - **Split Orders Button**: Appears on multi-item orders (2+ items, non-delivered/cancelled)
   - **Interactive Dialog**: Checkbox selection of items to split with real-time preview
   - **Smart Financials**: Proportional splitting of advance payment, GST, and discounts
   - **Auto-Recalculation**: Both orders get updated totals (subtotal, GST 12%, balance)
   - **Delivery Date Customization**: Set different delivery dates for split items
   - **Complete Audit Trail**: OrderHistory entries created for both orders
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Early delivery for specific items
     - Selective cancellation without affecting other items
     - Independent status tracking per garment
     - Split due to fabric availability timing
   - **API**: `POST /api/orders/[id]/split` with itemIds, deliveryDate, notes
   - **Validation**: Cannot split single-item orders or all items; prevents splitting delivered/cancelled orders

2. **Customer Order Metrics** (`components/customers/customer-orders-dialog.tsx`, `app/api/customers/route.ts`)
   - **Orders Delivered Metric**: Green badge showing count of DELIVERED orders (clickable)
   - **Orders In Progress Metric**: Blue badge showing count of active orders (clickable)
   - **Interactive Dialogs**: Click metrics to see filtered order lists with details
   - **Order List Display**:
     - Order number (clickable → navigates to order detail)
     - Status badge (color-coded)
     - Item count ("1 item" or "2 items")
     - Total amount
     - Delivery date and order date
   - **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no orders in category
   - **Event Handling**: Proper stopPropagation to prevent card navigation conflicts
   - **API Enhancement**: Fetches all orders with item counts via `_count.items`

3. **Dialog Text Visibility Fixes** (`components/ui/dialog.tsx`, `components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx`, `components/ui/sheet.tsx`)
   - **Problem**: Text was invisible due to CSS variable inheritance (light text on light background)
   - **Root Cause**: Components used `--foreground`, `--background` CSS variables from dark mode
   - **Solution**: Replaced CSS variables with explicit Tailwind classes
   - **Changes**:
     - Dialog/AlertDialog/Sheet Content: `bg-white text-slate-900`
     - Titles: `text-slate-900` (dark, high contrast)
     - Descriptions: `text-slate-600` (medium gray, readable)
   - **Impact**: All dialogs/modals now have clearly visible text
   - **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA contrast ratios (>7:1 for primary text)

4. **Customer Order Count Fix** (`app/api/customers/route.ts`, `app/(dashboard)/customers/page.tsx`)
   - **Bug**: All customers showed "5 orders" regardless of actual count
   - **Cause**: API fetched `take: 5` orders, frontend counted array length
   - **Fix**: Used Prisma `_count.orders` for accurate total
   - **Optimization**: Reduced query from fetching 5 orders to fetching only latest order (more efficient)
   - **Display**: Now shows actual counts (e.g., "15 orders" for customers with 15 orders)

**Files Added:**
- `app/api/orders/[id]/split/route.ts` - Order splitting API endpoint
- `components/orders/split-order-dialog.tsx` - Split order UI dialog
- `components/customers/customer-orders-dialog.tsx` - Customer order list dialog
- `components/ui/checkbox.tsx` - Checkbox component (shadcn)

- `app/api/customers/route.ts` - Enhanced to include all orders with item counts, added `_count.orders`
- `app/(dashboard)/customers/page.tsx` - Added order metrics with CustomerOrdersDialog
- `components/ui/dialog.tsx` - Fixed text colors for visibility
- `components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx` - Fixed text colors for visibility
- `components/ui/sheet.tsx` - Fixed text colors for visibility

**Order Splitting Workflow:**
1. Open multi-item order (e.g., 4 items: 2 shirts, 1 trouser, 1 suit)
2. Click "Split Order" button in Actions section
3. Select items to split (e.g., check 1 shirt and 1 trouser)
4. Set new delivery date for split items (e.g., 2 weeks earlier)
5. Add optional notes (e.g., "Customer needs shirt urgently")
6. Review preview:
   - New Order: 2 items, ₹15,000 (shirt + trouser)
   - Remaining Order: 2 items, ₹25,000 (shirt + suit)
7. Click "Split Order" to confirm
8. System creates new order with unique number (e.g., ORD-202601-0235)
9. Both orders show in history with split notes
10. Navigate to new order or continue with original

**Customer Card Order Metrics Workflow:**
1. View Customers page (https://hamees.gagneet.com/customers)
2. Each card shows:
   - "Orders Delivered: 12" (green, clickable)
   - "Orders In Progress: 3" (blue, clickable)
3. Click "Orders Delivered":
   - Dialog opens with all 12 delivered orders
   - Each order shows: number, status, item count, amount, dates
   - Click any order → navigates to order detail page
4. Click "Orders In Progress":
   - Dialog opens with 3 active orders
   - Shows NEW, CUTTING, STITCHING, READY orders
   - Click any order → navigates to order detail page

**Database Owner Note:**
The owner user (owner@hameesattire.com) name has been updated to "Jagmeet Dhariwal" in the database via direct SQL update.

```typescript
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1)
const [pageSize, setPageSize] = useState(10)
const [totalItems, setTotalItems] = useState(0)
const [totalPages, setTotalPages] = useState(0)

// Reset to page 1 when filters change
const clearFilters = () => {
  // ... clear other filters
  setCurrentPage(1)
}

// Smooth scroll on page change
const handlePageChange = (page: number) => {
  setCurrentPage(page)
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })
}
```

3. **Measurement Auto-Linking:**
```typescript
// Fetch customer's active measurements
const customerMeasurements = await prisma.measurement.findMany({
  where: { customerId, isActive: true },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
})

// Match by garment type
const garmentTypeName = pattern.name.replace(/^(Men's|Women's|Kids)\s+/i, '').trim()
const matchingMeasurement = customerMeasurements.find(
  m => m.garmentType.toLowerCase() === garmentTypeName.toLowerCase()
)

orderItems.push({
  // ... other fields
  measurementId: matchingMeasurement?.id,
})
```

## Architecture & Key Concepts

### Database Schema Architecture

The schema is built around a complete audit trail and stock reservation system:

1. **Inventory Management:**
   - `ClothInventory`: Tracks fabrics with `currentStock` (total meters) and `reserved` (meters reserved for orders)
   - **Available stock = currentStock - reserved**
   - When an order is created, fabric is auto-reserved via `StockMovement` records
   - `AccessoryInventory`: Manages buttons, threads, zippers with minimum stock thresholds

2. **Order Flow & Stock Reservation:**
   - Orders progress: NEW → MATERIAL_SELECTED → CUTTING → STITCHING → FINISHING → READY → DELIVERED
   - **Material Calculation:** `OrderItem.estimatedMeters` is calculated based on `GarmentPattern.baseMeters` + body type adjustment (SLIM/REGULAR/LARGE/XL)
   - When order is created with status NEW, fabric is reserved (creates `StockMovement` with type `ORDER_RESERVED`)
   - When cutting starts, `actualMetersUsed` is recorded and `wastage` is calculated
   - When order is cancelled, reservation is released (creates `StockMovement` with type `ORDER_CANCELLED`)

3. **Audit Trail:**
   - `StockMovement`: Complete history of all inventory changes with types: PURCHASE, ORDER_RESERVED, ORDER_USED, ORDER_CANCELLED, ADJUSTMENT, RETURN, WASTAGE
   - Each movement records `quantity` (positive/negative), `balanceAfter`, `userId`, and optional `orderId`

4. **Customer & Measurements:**
   - `Measurement`: Stores detailed measurements by garment type (Shirt, Trouser, Suit, Sherwani)
   - Supports history: multiple measurement records per customer for tracking changes
   - `additionalMeasurements` field (JSON) for flexible measurement storage

5. **Alerts System:**
   - Auto-generates alerts for low stock (when `currentStock - reserved < minimum`)
   - Alert types: LOW_STOCK, CRITICAL_STOCK, ORDER_DELAYED, REORDER_REMINDER
   - Severity levels: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL

6. **Supplier Management:**
   - `SupplierPrice`: Tracks price history with `effectiveFrom`/`effectiveTo` dates
   - `PurchaseOrder`: Manages restocking with status tracking (PENDING, RECEIVED, PARTIAL, CANCELLED)

### Design System

Custom color scheme defined in `app/globals.css`:
- **Primary (Indigo):** `#1E3A8A` - Main brand color
- **Secondary (Burgundy):** `#991B1B` - Accent color
- **Accent (Gold):** `#F59E0B` - Highlights and warnings
- **Success (Green):** `#10B981` - Success states
- **Error (Red):** `#EF4444` - Errors
- **Info (Blue):** `#3B82F6` - Information

Currency formatting uses Indian Rupees (INR) via `formatCurrency()` in `lib/utils.ts`.

## Development Guidelines

### Working with Database

1. **Schema changes:**
   - Modify `prisma/schema.prisma`
   - Run `pnpm db:push` for development (quick iteration)
   - Run `pnpm db:migrate` for production (creates migration files)

2. **Accessing Prisma Client:**
   - Always import from `lib/db.ts`: `import { prisma } from '@/lib/db'`
   - Client is singleton to prevent connection exhaustion in development
   - **IMPORTANT:** Prisma 7 requires the PostgreSQL adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`)

3. **Prisma 7 Configuration:**
   - Schema uses `engineType = "binary"` in generator block
   - Client initialization requires `PrismaPg` adapter with connection pool
   - All database operations use the adapter pattern (see `lib/db.ts` and `prisma/seed.ts`)

   Example:
   ```typescript
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
   import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'
   import { Pool } from 'pg'

   const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL })
   const adapter = new PrismaPg(pool)
   const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
   ```

4. **Stock Reservation Pattern:**
   - When creating orders that reserve fabric, always create corresponding `StockMovement` records
   - Update `ClothInventory.reserved` field accordingly
   - Use transactions (`prisma.$transaction`) for atomic operations

### Authentication (Phase 2 - In Progress)

- NextAuth.js v5 (beta) configured for credentials provider
- User roles: OWNER, ADMIN, INVENTORY_MANAGER, SALES_MANAGER, TAILOR, VIEWER
- Passwords hashed with bcryptjs (10 salt rounds)
- Environment requires `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL`

### Route Protection Pattern

Routes under `app/(dashboard)/` will be protected via NextAuth middleware (to be implemented).

## Important Notes

- **Body Type Calculations:** When calculating fabric requirements, use `GarmentPattern.baseMeters + GarmentPattern.[bodyType]Adjustment`
- **Stock Availability:** Always check `currentStock - reserved >= requiredAmount` before reserving fabric
- **Order Numbers:** Generate via `generateOrderNumber()` which uses timestamp + random suffix
- **SKU Generation:** Use `generateSKU(type, brand)` for new inventory items
- **Currency:** All monetary values are in INR (Indian Rupees)

## Current Development Status

- ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Database schema, seed data, project setup
- ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Authentication system (NextAuth.js v5, JWT sessions, route protection)
- ✅ Phase 3 Complete: API routes for inventory CRUD, barcode lookup, stock movements
